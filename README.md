**Hi, this is a small game that was created by me to get to know Python better.**\
\
It contains aliens who want to destroy your spaceship. But you're a lucky player cause you have bullets to kill them first. \
Even if you lose _one spaceship_, don't be sad. You still have 2 more to show them who is real **boss** here.\
Points for killing are getting bigger with new rounds. The same I can tell about aliens speed.\
_You can always try to beat your record_, cause it will always appear in the middle of the screen.\

Hope, you are going to like the game ;)
